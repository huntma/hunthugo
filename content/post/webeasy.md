# Create Your Own Website and How to Edit it
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Why a Website  

* Your website is your internet ID. Put as much or as little info as you want.

* It is an official place to showcase your work.

* It is a way to get an edge in job hunts, and also really show off your cool projects.

<br>
<br>

_okay let's get to it..._

<br>
<br>
### Set up a new site
<br>
![Github sign up](/image/002github1.PNG)
Quite simple.

![Github 2](/image/002github2.PNG)

You can skip the 3rd step of tailoring your experience
Make a professional username. Please. No kittenSlayer44 or anything like that.

Our website will be a project on Github. Project name is "[your username].github.io".

_When do I do the magic to upload my site on the web?_

Github contains a program called Github Pages that automatically creates your websitefrom that project you just created. They made it so that it MUST have that name though. Pics below.

{{ < figure src= "/image/170418_repo.PNG" >}}
Navigate here to start a new repo.

![Repo1](/image/170418_repo1.PNG)
Type into this field "[your username].github.io"

![Repo2](/image/170418_repo2.PNG)
TODO: change default size of images
You will see this. Click Readme. Write anything. This is the first file in your project.

_More info_  
> A README is a text file has information about the software that the creator thought that users should know before using. Like a user manual. 

Create new file and name it "index.html".

_More info_
> index.html is a weird name. Why? Because when the browser is looking for html files to generate the page, it is in the standard to look for this specific name.

We will build one piece of our website at a time.

### Edits You Can Do



### Continue to Evolve!

1. You can extend your website into a blog.

Look into using a Static Site Generator. This site is made using Hugo. There are some pretty good tutorials out there, but to be honest I needed to use multiple ones to really learn how to do it. There's no single, super-complete one out there.

2. Buy your own domain name and attach it to your website. 

More Info:  
All websites need to live somewhere. Ours lives on the Github servers which are actual computers sitting somewheres wired up to the internet. This website just needs an easy name to remember instead of a complicated IP address like 198.162.0.0. This assigning of names to IP addresses is handled by big organizations called Domain Name Registrars.

3. Learn about Github

Google git tutorial and do it. Git is a fast, lightweight program designed to keep a history of your projects on computers. This is a type of _version control_ system. Github is just a website built using this tool to give you a clickable interface and providing online servers to store your projects.

4. HTML and CSS
